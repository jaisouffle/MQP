Your analysis should include:-Complex name-Complex function-The organism the complex belongs to-List of proteins the complex consists of-List of corresponding genes the proteins belong to-List of other organisms that the protein complex is found in only if applicable(from the 5 previously mentioned).After completing your analysis, also assign a self confidence score for the data findings to help gauge the accuracy of the information. The score should range from 0.00 to 1.00, with 0.00 being the lowest confidence and 1.00 indicating the highest confidence. To determine your score, consider the following grading conventions:-Consistency of information across different databases/sources(0.30 weight)-Supporting experimental data regarding the complex(0.3 weight)-Accuracy of corresponding protein-gene mapping(0.25 weight)-The analysis information being specific to the organism that it is most promininent in(0.15 weight).The weight in parentheses following each grading convention signifies how much each criteria should effect the confidence score with a total of 1.00 if every criteria is completely accurate.
