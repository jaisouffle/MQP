Additionally, list the other organisms that the protein complex is found in only if applicable. Aftercompleting your analysis, also assign a self confidence score for the data findings to help gauge the accuracy of the information. The score should range from 0.00 to 1.00, with 0.00 being the lowest confidence and 1.00 indicating the highest confidence. To determine your score, consider the following grading conventions: consistency of information across different databases/sources(0.3 weight), supporting experimental data regarding the complex(0.3 weight), accuracy of corresponding protein-gene mapping(0.25 weight), and the analysis information being specific to the organism that it is most promininent in(0.15 weight).
