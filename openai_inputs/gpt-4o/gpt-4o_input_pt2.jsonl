To determine your score, consider the following grading conventions:\n-Consistency of information across different databases/sources(0.30 weight)\n-Supporting experimental data regarding the complex(0.3 weight)\n-Accuracy of corresponding protein-gene mapping(0.25 weight)\n-The analysis information being specific to the organism that it is most promininent in(0.15 weight).\nThe weight in parentheses following each grading convention signifies how much each criteria should effect the confidence score with a total of 1.00 if every criteria is completely accurate. Please only return the final confidence score equation with corresponding weights. Here is an example of the total output for two complexes:\n'Complex Name: ATP4A-ATP4B complex'\n'Complex Function: This is a part of the larger ATP4 or H+/K+ ATPase complex, a proton pump responsible for gastric acid secretion in the stomach.'\n'Organism: Human'\n'Other Organisms: N/A'\n'Proteins: Potassium-transporting ATPase alpha chain 1, Potassium-transporting ATPase subunit beta'\n'Genes: ATP4A, ATP4B'\n'Self Confidence Score: (0.95 \u00d7 0.3) + (0.9 \u00d7 0.3) + (1.0 \u00d7 0.25) + (1.0 \u00d7 0.15) = 0.285 + 0.27 + 0.25 + 0.15  = **0.955**'\n\n'Complex Name: Sodium leak channel complex'\n'Complex Function: Voltage-gated ion channel responsible for the depolarizing sodium (Na+) leak currentsthat determine resting Na(+) permeability and control neuronal excitability.
