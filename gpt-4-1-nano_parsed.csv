contextual,Cardiac Troponin Complex,Human,Mouse (Mus musculus),"The cardiac troponin complex regulates cardiac muscle contraction by modulating the interaction between actin and myosin in response to calcium binding, playing a crucial role in the contractile mechanism of human cardiac muscle cells.",- Troponin C (TNNC1); - Troponin I (TNNI3); - Troponin T (TNNT2),"- TNNI3 (Troponin I cardiac isoform); - TNNT2 (Troponin T cardiac isoform); - TNNC1 (Troponin C); Supporting experimental data confirms the presence and functional importance of this complex in human cardiac tissue. The proteins are highly conserved in mice, indicating similar roles across mammals. Data sources such as Human Protein Atlas and published cardiac muscle studies support these findings.",(0.95 × 0.3) + (0.9 × 0.3) + (1.0 × 0.25) + (1.0 × 0.15) = 0.285 + 0.27 + 0.25 + 0.15 = **0.955**
