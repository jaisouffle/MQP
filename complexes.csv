Ste12/Dig1/Dig2 transcription regulation complex,Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast),"This complex is involved in the regulation of gene expression in response to mating signals in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast). It plays a crucial role in controlling the transcription of genes essential for the sexual differentiation process, particularly during the pheromone response pathway. The complex helps modulate the transcriptional output by integrating signals from the pheromone receptors and preventing premature activation of the mating response.",1. Ste12; 2. Dig1; 3. Dig2,1.
