contextual,NatA (N-terminal acetyltransferase A) complex,Human,"Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (NatA is also present and highly characterized in yeast, where it acetylates about 60% of proteins; metazoan NatA complexes are found in other eukaryotes as well[1]).","NatA is a co-translational N-terminal acetyltransferase that modifies the amino-terminus of nascent proteins as they emerge from the ribosome. In humans, NatA acetylates approximately 85% of the proteome's N-termini, affecting protein degradation, folding, interactions, localization, and cellular morphology. Dysregulation of NatA activity has been linked to human diseases including cancer, developmental, and neurological disorders[1].",- NAA10 (catalytic subunit),- NAA10,\[
