Endosomal SNARE complex TLG2-VTI1-TLG1-SNC2,Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast),"The Endosomal SNARE complex facilitates the fusion of endosomal membranes, which is essential for intracellular transportation and the sorting of cargoes within the endosomal system. It plays a critical role in the trafficking of proteins and lipids, contributing to various cellular processes including nutrient uptake, signal transduction, and viral entry.",1. TLG2 (Tlg2p) 2. VTI1 (Vti1p) 3. TLG1 (Tlg1p) 4. SNC2 (Snc2p),1. TLG2 - TLG2 gene 2. VTI1 - VTI1 gene 3. TLG1 - TLG1 gene 4. SNC2 - SNC2 gene,"This specific SNARE complex is primarily characterized in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and data on its presence in other organisms from the given list is limited.",1.0

Ste12/Dig1/Dig2 transcription regulation complex,Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast),"This complex is involved in the regulation of gene expression in response to mating signals in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast). It plays a crucial role in controlling the transcription of genes essential for the sexual differentiation process, particularly during the pheromone response pathway. The complex helps modulate the transcriptional output by integrating signals from the pheromone receptors and preventing premature activation of the mating response.",1. Ste12 2. Dig1 3. Dig2,1. STE12 (gene encoding Ste12 protein) 2. DIG1 (gene encoding Dig1 protein) 3. DIG2 (gene encoding Dig2 protein),"Not applicable, as this complex has not been prominently identified in the other listed organisms (Human, Mouse, C. elegans, Drosophila melanogaster).",1.00
