In humans, GRIN1 is critical for NMDA receptor function, which is involved in synaptic transmission, plasticity, and excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. P2RY4 is a G protein-coupled receptor responsive to nucleotides like UTP and ATP, implicated in modulation of neuronal signaling pathways and glial functions.\n\nThe hypothetical complex between GRIN1 and P2RY4 suggests a functional interaction where P2RY4 signaling might modulate NMDA receptor activity, contributing to fine-tuning synaptic responses or neurophysiological processes. However, direct stable complex formation evidence is limited and mostly derived from functional assays rather than structurally stable complexes.\n\n---\n\n### Proteins in the Complex:\n- **GRIN1**: N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit 1\n- **P2RY4**: Pyrimidinergic receptor P2Y4\n\n---\n\n### Corresponding Genes:\n- **GRIN1 gene**: *GRIN1* (Gene ID: 2902, Human)\n- **P2RY4 gene**: *P2RY4* (Gene ID: 5029, Human)\n\n---\n\n### Other Organisms Containing This Complex:\n- Orthologous proteins exist individually in **Mouse** (*Mus musculus*) where both *Grin1* and *P2ry4* genes are present and widely studied in neuroscience. There is no confirmed evidence of a physical protein complex between these two proteins in mouse, but functional interactions via signaling pathways may exist.\n- In **Drosophila melanogaster** and **Caenorhabditis elegans**, orthologs of GRIN1 or P2RY4 are either not well-conserved or absent, hence no known complex.\n- **Saccharomyces cerevisiae** does not contain orthologs for these proteins; no presence of this complex.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe GRIN1-P2RY4 complex is most specific and relevant in humans, possibly representing functional crosstalk between glutamate NMDA receptor function (GRIN1) and purinergic signaling (P2RY4).

It acts by recruiting the \u03b3-tubulin ring complex (\u03b3-TuRC) to existing spindle microtubules, promoting branching microtubule nucleation and thus enhancing spindle microtubule density. This function ensures proper spindle assembly, accurate chromosome segregation, and mitotic progression.\n\n### Protein Composition of the Human Augmin Complex (HAUS complex)  \nThe human Augmin complex consists of 8 subunits, commonly named HAUS1 through HAUS8.\n\n| Protein Subunit | Gene Name   |\n|-----------------|-------------|\n| HAUS1           | HAUS1       |\n| HAUS2           | HAUS2       |\n| HAUS3           | HAUS3       |\n| HAUS4           | HAUS4       |\n| HAUS5           | HAUS5       |\n| HAUS6           | HAUS6       |\n| HAUS7           | HAUS7       |\n| HAUS8           | HAUS8       |\n\n---\n\n### Other Organisms Where the Augmin Complex Is Found  \n- *Drosophila melanogaster* (fruit fly) \u2014 where the complex was originally characterized and named \u201caugmin\u201d based on mutant screens affecting spindle assembly.  \n- *Mus musculus* (mouse) \u2014 orthologous proteins and functions homologous to humans.  \n- *Caenorhabditis elegans* \u2014 partial conservation with some functional homologs reported, but less characterized in detail.  \n- The complex is **not present** in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (budding yeast), which lacks canonical augmin subunits.\n\n---\n\n### Supporting Details Specific to Human Augmin Complex  \n- The HAUS complex (Augmin) localizes to the mitotic spindle and promotes \u03b3-TuRC recruitment to spindle microtubules.  \n- Disruption of any HAUS subunit in human cells by RNAi leads to decreased spindle microtubule density and chromosome mis-segregation phenotypes.  \n- The eight HAUS proteins form a stable hetero-octameric complex, structurally resolved in recent cryo-EM studies, confirming protein-protein interactions and overall architecture.  \n- The gene-protein mapping is unequivocal, with one-to-one correspondence between HAUS genes and HAUS protein subunits.  \n\n---\n\n### Self Confidence Score Computation\n\n| Criterion                              | Weight | Score (0 to 1) | Weighted Score |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|----------------|----------------|\n| Consistency across databases/sources | 0.30   | 1.00           | 0.30           |\n| Supporting experimental data          | 0.30   | 0.95           | 0.285          |\n| Protein-gene mapping accuracy         | 0.25   | 1.00           | 0.25           |\n| Organism-specificity of information    | 0.15   | 1.00           | 0.15           |\n| **Total**                            | 1.00   | -              | **0.985**      |\n\n---\n\n### Final Remarks  \nThe information about the human Augmin complex (HAUS complex) is well-characterized with strong experimental backing, clear gene-protein mapping, and consistent reporting across major databases (UniProt, NCBI, literature).

It is essential for vesicle tethering and fusion at the late Golgi, thereby regulating membrane trafficking within the secretory pathway and aiding in the sorting and transport of vesicles from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the plasma membrane or endosomes. The complex plays a critical role in Golgi organization and dynamics, ensuring proper cargo delivery and Golgi maturation.\n\n---\n\n**Proteins Constituting TRAPP II Complex and Corresponding Genes (in *S. cerevisiae*):**\n\n| Protein (Subunit) | Gene          |\n|-------------------|---------------|\n| Bet3              | BET3          |\n| Bet5              | BET5          |\n| Trs20             | TRS20         |\n| Trs23             | TRS23         |\n| Trs31             | TRS31         |\n| Trs33             | TRS33         |\n| Trs65             | TRS65         |\n| Trs120            | TRS120        |\n| Trs130            | TRS130        |\n| Trs85 (generally in TRAPP III; not typical for TRAPP II) | TRS85 (not generally included) |\n\n- Note: The core TRAPP I complex is composed of the first six (Bet3, Bet5, Trs20, Trs23, Trs31, Trs33). TRAPP II incorporates these core subunits plus specific subunits like Trs120 and Trs130, which define its unique function at the late Golgi.\n\n---\n\n**Other Organisms where TRAPP II is Found:**\n\n- Homologs of TRAPP II have been characterized in *Homo sapiens* (humans), *Mus musculus* (mouse), and *Drosophila melanogaster*. The complex is conserved across eukaryotes, with functional homologs identified that regulate distinct Golgi trafficking routes. Human TRAPP II shares similar core functions but may contain divergent subunits and regulatory mechanisms due to organismal complexity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The most detailed, experimentally supported understanding of TRAPP II resides in *S. cerevisiae*.\n- TRAPP II extends the TRAPP I core by adding Trs120 and Trs130, specializing it for late Golgi/TGN functions.\n- The complex acts as a Ypt31/Ypt32 GEF, linking vesicle trafficking to Rab GTPase control.\n- Conservation across eukaryotes suggests similar roles, though substrate specificity and protein composition may vary.\n\n---\n\n### Self-Confidence Score Calculation\n\n1. **Consistency across databases/sources (0.3 weight):**  \n- High concordance across protein databases (UniProt, SGD), literature (peer-reviewed studies on *S. cerevisiae*), and pathway databases on subunit composition and function.  \n**Score: 0.95**\n\n2. **Supporting experimental data regarding the complex (0.3 weight):**  \n- Extensive genetic, biochemical, and microscopy studies in yeast confirm TRAPP II composition and function, including GEF activity for Ypt31/32, and identification of essential subunits Trs120 and Trs130.  \n**Score: 0.9**\n\n3. **Accuracy of protein-gene mapping (0.25 weight):**  \n- Established gene-protein mappings in *S. cerevisiae* are well-curated and unambiguous, with standard gene names used widely.  \n**Score: 1.0**\n\n4. **Specificity to the organism most prominent in (0.15 weight):**  \n- Analysis specifically and exclusively focused on yeast TRAPP II, with only brief notes on homologs in other organisms, avoiding overgeneralization.  \n**Score: 0.9**\n\n---\n\n**Overall Confidence Score:**\n\n= (0.95 * 0.3) + (0.9 * 0.3) + (1.0 * 0.25) + (0.9 * 0.15)  \n= 0.285 + 0.27 + 0.25 + 0.135  \n= **0.94**\n\n---\n\n### Final Confidence: **0.94/1.00**", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 304, "completion_tokens": 976, "total_tokens": 1280, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_38647f5e19"}}, "error": null}
