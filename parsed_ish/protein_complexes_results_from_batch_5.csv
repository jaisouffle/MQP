  Sodium leak channel complex (NALCN complex)  

Function:  
  The NALCN complex forms a voltage‑independent, nonselective cation leak channel at the plasma membrane.

Ste12/Dig1/Dig2 transcription regulation complex,zero-shot,ChatGPT,PARSE ERROR,UNKNOWN,"Organism:  
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast)

Complex name:  
Ste12–Dig1–Dig2 transcription regulation complex

Complex function:  
This ternary complex regulates mating‐ and filamentation‐specific gene expression in response to pheromone signaling. Ste12 is the central C2H2 zinc‐finger transcription activator; Dig1 (also known as Rst1) and Dig2 (Rst2) bind Ste12's activation domains to repress its activity in the absence of pheromone. Upon MAPK cascade activation (via Fus3/Kss1), inhibitory phosphorylation events and protein dissociation permit Ste12 to drive transcription of genes required for mating projection (“shmoo”) formation and cell‐cycle arrest.

Proteins in the complex and their genes:  
1. Ste12  
   • Protein: Ste12p  
   • UniProt: P18413  
   • Gene: STE12 (YHR062C)

Other organisms:  
No direct orthologous Ste12–Dig1–Dig2 complex has been characterized outside of Saccharomyces‐type budding yeasts. While Ste12 is a member of a broadly conserved family of fungal C2H2 transcription factors, the specific Dig1/Dig2 inhibitory regulators and their ternary assembly appear restricted to Saccharomyces and very closely related hemiascomycete species.

Ste12/Dig1/Dig2 transcription regulation complex,few-shot,ChatGPT,PARSE ERROR,UNKNOWN,"Complex Name: Ste12–Dig1–Dig2 transcription regulation complex  
Organism: Saccharomyces cerevisiae  
Other Organisms: Orthologous Ste12 regulatory modules exist across the Saccharomyces sensu stricto clade (e.g. S. paradoxus, S. bayanus), but the three‐member Ste12–Dig1–Dig2 assembly is best characterized in S. cerevisiae.  

Complex Function:  
In S. cerevisiae, Ste12 is the master transcription factor for mating‐type and filamentation genes. Under nonstimulated conditions, Dig1 and Dig2 bind Ste12 and mask its activation domains. Upon pheromone (mating) or nutrient‐limitation signals, the MAP kinases Fus3 (mating) or Kss1 (filamentation) phosphorylate Dig1 and Dig2. Phosphorylation reduces their affinity for Ste12, releasing Ste12 to dimerize, bind pheromone‐responsive element (PRE) sequences in promoters (e.g. FUS1, FAR1 for mating; TEC1, FLO11 for filamentation), and activate transcription. This switch controls cell‐cycle arrest, shmoo formation, mating‐type switching, and invasive/filamentous growth.

• Ste12p (Transcription factor Ste12)  
• Dig1p (Repressor of Ste12; also known as Rst1)

Complex Function: In the absence of mating pheromone, Dig1p and Dig2p bind Ste12p and repress its activity at pheromone-response elements (PREs), preventing transcription of mating-specific and filamentation genes.

20S mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit,contextual,ChatGPT,PARSE ERROR,UNKNOWN,"Complex Name: 20S mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit  
Organism: Human  
Other Organisms: Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae  

Complex Function:  
The mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit (mt‑SSU) binds mitochondrial mRNAs and initiates and decodes polypeptide synthesis within the organelle. In human mitochondria it is commonly referred to as the 28S subunit, although older sedimentation-based nomenclature sometimes labels it “20S.”
