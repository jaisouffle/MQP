"Cardiac troponin complex Complex Function: The cardiac troponin complex regulates calcium-mediated contraction of cardiac muscle by controlling the interaction between actin and myosin. Upon calcium binding, it induces a conformational change that permits cross-bridge cycling essential for cardiac muscle contraction and relaxation cycles. This regulation is critical for the proper timing and force of heart contractions.","Human Proteins: - Cardiac troponin C (cTnC) - Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) - Cardiac troponin T (cTnT) Genes: - TNNC1 (troponin C type 1, slow skeletal and cardiac) - TNNI3 (troponin I type 3, cardiac) - TNNT2 (troponin T type 2, cardiac) Other Organisms: The cardiac troponin complex is also found in Mouse, Drosophila melanogaster, and other vertebrates; however, the specific isoforms and gene sequences differ. It is not present in Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Caenorhabditis elegans, which do not have striated cardiac muscle. Self Confidence Score: 0.96 - Consistency across databases/sources (0.30 weight): The composition and function of the cardiac troponin complex are well-documented and highly consistent. - Supporting experimental data (0.30 weight): Extensive biochemical, biophysical, and structural studies support the cardiac troponin complex function in humans. - Protein-gene mapping accuracy (0.25 weight): Protein and gene assignments are well established and experimentally verified. - Specificity to organism (0.15 weight): The analysis is specific to the human cardiac troponin complex, the most studied and functionally characterized among species listed.","The cardiac troponin complex regulates calcium-mediated contraction of cardiac muscle by controlling the interaction between actin and myosin.
