ATP4A-ATP4B complex,zero-shot,ChatGPT,PARSE ERROR,UNKNOWN,"**Organism:** Human (Homo sapiens)

---

### Complex Name:
**Gastric H+/K+ ATPase (ATP4A-ATP4B complex)**

---

### Complex Function:
The ATP4A-ATP4B complex functions as the gastric proton pump responsible for acid secretion in the stomach parietal cells. It maintains the acidic environment by exchanging intracellular H+ ions with extracellular K+ ions, enabling digestion and pathogen defense in the gastric lumen.

---

### Proteins in the Complex:
1. **ATP4A** – the alpha subunit (catalytic subunit), responsible for ATP hydrolysis and proton transport.
2. **ATP4B** – the beta subunit (regulatory/subunit), essential for stabilization, trafficking, and functional expression of the alpha subunit on the plasma membrane.

---

### Corresponding Genes:
- **ATP4A gene** → encodes the alpha subunit (P-type ATPase family)
- **ATP4B gene** → encodes the beta subunit

---

### Other Organisms Where the Complex Is Found (if applicable):
- The ATP4A-ATP4B complex is also present and functionally conserved in **Mouse (Mus musculus)**, where it plays an analogous role in gastric acid secretion.
- It is largely specific to vertebrates with stomach acid secretion; absent or divergent in organisms like *Caenorhabditis elegans*, *Drosophila melanogaster*, or *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*.

---

### Summary:
The human ATP4A-ATP4B complex is a heterodimeric gastric proton pump essential for stomach acidification. ATP4A acts as the catalytic subunit, hydrolyzing ATP to drive proton transport, while ATP4B stabilizes and enables proper localization of ATP4A. This complex is primarily studied in humans and mice and is absent in typical model organisms without a similar gastric function.

---

### Organism
- **Mouse (Mus musculus)**

---

### Complex Name
- **Synaptonemal Complex (SC)**

---

### Complex Function
The Synaptonemal Complex is a tripartite proteinaceous structure that forms between homologous chromosomes during the prophase stage of meiosis I. Its principal functions are to mediate synapsis (the alignment and stabilization of homologous chromosomes), facilitate homologous recombination (crossing over), and ensure proper segregation of homologs during meiosis. In mice, the SC is essential for fertility and genome stability.

---

### Protein Components and Corresponding Genes

The mouse SC can be divided into three main structural elements:

1. **Lateral Elements (LE):** These align on each homologous chromosome.
2. **Transverse Filaments (TF):** These connect the lateral elements.
3. **Central Element (CE):** Located in the central region.

| SYCE3        | Central Element             | Syce3        |

- **SYCP1** forms the transverse filaments connecting paired chromosomes.
- **SYCP2 and SYCP3** form the structural foundation of the lateral elements.
- **SYCE1, SYCE2, SYCE3, and TEX12** form the central element complex that stabilizes the SC's central region.

- **Mouse (Mus musculus):** The best-characterized model, with well-defined proteins above.
- **Saccharomyces cerevisiae:** Has functional analogs of SC proteins but with low sequence similarity.
- **Caenorhabditis elegans:** Possesses analogous proteins (e.g., SYP family) with distinct sequences.

---

### Organism:
**Homo sapiens (Human)**

---

### Complex Name:
**GNA12-GPR55-RGS2 complex**

---

### Complex Composition (Proteins):
1. **GNA12** - Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G12 subunit alpha
2. **GPR55** - G protein-coupled receptor 55
3. **RGS2** - Regulator of G protein signaling 2

2. **GPR55** gene (Entrez Gene ID: 2829)
3. **RGS2** gene (Entrez Gene ID: 5991)

---

### Functional Overview:
- The GNA12-GPR55-RGS2 complex functions primarily in **G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling modulation**.
- **GPR55** functions as a GPCR, implicated in signaling pathways related to inflammation, pain, and possibly cancer progression.
- **GNA12** is a Gα12 subunit that couples to GPCRs like GPR55, activating downstream effectors such as Rho GTPases leading to cytoskeletal reorganization and transcriptional responses.
- **RGS2** acts as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Gα subunits, including Gα12, accelerating GTP hydrolysis, thereby attenuating signaling — effectively acting as a negative regulator within the complex.
- Together, this complex regulates the dynamics of GPR55-mediated signaling by controlling both activation (via GNA12) and inactivation (via RGS2), maintaining cellular homeostasis in signaling pathways crucial to vascular tone, inflammation, and cellular proliferation.

---

### Organism Specificity and Other Organisms:
- The **GNA12-GPR55-RGS2 complex is primarily characterized in humans**, where all three proteins are well annotated and experimentally studied in the context of human physiology and pathology.
- **Mouse** (Mus musculus) orthologs exist for all three proteins, and similar interactions might occur; however, a specific characterized complex involving all three exactly as in humans is sparse in direct experimental studies.
- This complex or its components are **not reported in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, or Saccharomyces cerevisiae** due to limited homologous GPCR signaling components or functional divergence of G-protein signaling.
- Therefore, the highest confidence is in the human context.

---

### Supporting Evidence Summary:
- **Databases cross-reference** (UniProt, GeneCards, NCBI, Reactome) support the protein-gene mappings and the presence of interactions between these proteins.
- **Experimental data**: Human studies have demonstrated GPR55 coupling preferentially to Gα12/13 family G proteins, and RGS2's role in regulating Gα12 signaling is supported by biochemical assays.
- Direct structural or stable complex co-precipitation data specific to the triad (GNA12-GPR55-RGS2) is limited but inferred from known GPCR-G protein-RGS interactions.

GNA12-GPR55-RGS2 complex,few-shot,ChatGPT,PARSE ERROR,UNKNOWN,"Complex Name: GNA12-GPR55-RGS2 complex  
Organism: Human  

Complex Function:  
The GNA12-GPR55-RGS2 complex in humans is involved in modulating G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways, particularly relating to cellular responses to extracellular stimuli affecting processes like cell proliferation, migration, and inflammatory responses. GPR55 acts as a non-classical cannabinoid receptor that signals through the heterotrimeric G protein subunit GNA12 (Gα12). RGS2 serves as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that accelerates the deactivation of GNA12, thereby regulating signal termination and preventing excessive signaling. This complex plays a crucial role in fine-tuning pathways linked to cardiovascular function, cancer progression, and immune responses.

Proteins in the complex:  
- G protein subunit alpha 12 (GNA12)  
- G protein-coupled receptor 55 (GPR55)  
- Regulator of G protein signaling 2 (RGS2)  

Corresponding Genes:  
- GNA12  
- GPR55  
- RGS2  

Other Organisms:  
The GNA12, GPR55, and RGS2 proteins are conserved across various mammals (e.g., mouse), however, the specific interaction as a defined complex is most characterized in humans. Functional homologs exist in mouse, but detailed studies of the exact GNA12-GPR55-RGS2 ternary complex remain limited outside of human systems. No direct evidence supports this specific complex in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, or Saccharomyces cerevisiae, likely due to either absence of GPR55 orthologs or divergence in GPCR signaling mechanisms.

Organism: Human  

Complex Function:  
The Melanocortin receptor 3 (MC3R) complex functions primarily as a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis, body weight, and metabolism. MC3R plays a critical role in modulating appetite, nutrient partitioning, and circadian rhythms related to feeding behavior. The receptor transduces signals primarily through coupling to Gs proteins, activating adenylate cyclase and increasing intracellular cyclic AMP levels upon binding melanocortin peptides derived from pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC). MC3R also influences immune responses and has a regulatory role in inflammation.  

Proteins in the Complex:  
1. Melanocortin receptor 3 (MC3R) – the core receptor protein  
2. G-protein subunits commonly associated with MC3R signaling (primarily Gs alpha subunit)  
3. Accessory proteins that modulate receptor trafficking and signaling such as MRAP2 (Melanocortin receptor accessory protein 2)  

Genes corresponding to the proteins:  
- MC3R gene (codes for Melanocortin receptor 3)  
- GNAS gene (codes for the Gs alpha subunit)  
- MRAP2 gene (codes for Melanocortin receptor accessory protein 2)  

Other organisms:  
Besides humans, MC3R orthologs are found in Mouse (Mus musculus) and other vertebrates with conserved functions in energy homeostasis and metabolism. However, the complex and its accessory modulation are best characterized and most prominent in humans and mice; invertebrates like Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, or fungi such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae lack true MC3R orthologs.

### Complex Function:

The ATP1A1-TSHR complex refers to a putative or functionally relevant complex involving the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase alpha-1 subunit (ATP1A1) and the Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Receptor (TSHR). Both proteins have distinct primary roles but may form a complex with regulatory or signaling implications particularly in thyroid physiology.

- **ATP1A1:** Catalytic subunit of the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase pump responsible for maintaining the electrochemical gradients of Na⁺ and K⁺ across the plasma membrane, crucial for cellular homeostasis.
- **TSHR:** A G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) essential for thyroid gland function and regulation of thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion through binding Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH).

Interaction or complex formation between ATP1A1 and TSHR could play a role in modulating receptor localization, signaling, or ion transport in thyroid cells, although there is limited direct experimental evidence confirming a stable binary complex.

### Proteins in the Complex:

- **ATP1A1** — Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase alpha-1 subunit
- **TSHR** — Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Receptor

- **TSHR gene** — encodes the TSHR protein

---

### Organism:

- The complex is most prominently associated with **Humans (Homo sapiens)** because:
  - ATP1A1 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and characterized well.
  - TSHR is specifically expressed in human thyroid follicular cells.
  - Functionality and physiological relevance of TSHR is best documented in humans for thyroid hormonal control.
- While both ATP1A1 and GPCRs (like TSHR) are conserved across species, the specific ATP1A1-TSHR complex, by name and functional significance, is predominantly studied and relevant in humans.

### Other Organisms:

- **Mouse (Mus musculus):** Homologous proteins exist (Atp1a1 and Tshr genes); however, the ATP1A1-TSHR complex has not been explicitly identified or characterized as a complex in mice.
- **Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Saccharomyces cerevisiae:** These organisms either lack a direct TSHR homolog or its thyroid hormone regulation mechanism. ATP1A1 homologs exist (Na⁺/K⁺-ATPases), but no TSHR or ATP1A1-TSHR interaction is described.

#### Organism:
**Human (Homo sapiens)**

This complex is primarily characterized in humans, where both Bdkrb2 and Tbxa2r proteins are well-studied.

#### Complex Name:
**Bdkrb2-Tbxa2r complex**

This name reflects the heteromeric protein complex formed by the Bradykinin receptor B2 (Bdkrb2) and the Thromboxane A2 receptor (Tbxa2r).

#### Complex Function:
The Bdkrb2-Tbxa2r complex participates in modulating vascular tone and platelet aggregation through G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling interplay:

- **Bdkrb2** is a Gq/11-coupled receptor primarily involved in vasodilation, mediating bradykinin-induced nitric oxide release and smooth muscle relaxation.
- **Tbxa2r** is another G protein-coupled receptor primarily associated with vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation, activated by thromboxane A2.

Their complex formation is proposed to enable cross-regulation in vascular homeostasis by integrating opposing signals from bradykinin and thromboxane A2 pathways. This heteromerization can affect receptor trafficking, downstream signaling bias, and receptor pharmacology, implicating the complex in cardiovascular regulation and inflammatory responses.

#### Proteins in the Complex:
- **Bdkrb2** (Bradykinin receptor B2)
- **Tbxa2r** (Thromboxane A2 receptor)

#### Corresponding Genes:

### Complex Name:
**Ceacam1-4L-Syk-Tlr4 complex**

---

### Complex Function:
This complex is primarily involved in the modulation of immune responses, particularly in the regulation of innate immune signaling in myeloid cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells. It plays a crucial role in tuning TLR4-mediated signaling pathways by integrating inhibitory and activating signals, thus impacting inflammation and immune homeostasis.

Specifically, CEACAM1 (Carcinoembryonic Antigen-related Cell Adhesion Molecule 1) with the long cytoplasmic tail isoform (4L) interacts with the TLR4 receptor complex upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. The recruitment of Syk kinase to this complex amplifies downstream signaling, affecting pro-inflammatory cytokine production and potentially influencing endotoxemia and sepsis outcomes.

Ceacam1-4L-Syk-Tlr4 complex,few-shot,ChatGPT,PARSE ERROR,UNKNOWN,"Complex Name: CEACAM1-4L-Syk-TLR4 complex  
Organism: Mouse  
Complex Function: This complex plays a key role in modulating innate immune responses, particularly in myeloid cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells. CEACAM1-4L acts as an inhibitory receptor regulating Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling. Upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, the long cytoplasmic tail isoform of CEACAM1 (CEACAM1-4L) recruits the tyrosine kinase Syk, which modulates downstream TLR4-mediated pro-inflammatory signaling and cytokine production, thus fine-tuning inflammatory responses. This regulation helps prevent excessive inflammation and maintain immune homeostasis during pathogen recognition.  

Proteins in the Complex:  
- Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 isoform with four extracellular domains and a long cytoplasmic tail (CEACAM1-4L)  
- Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk)  
- Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)  

Corresponding Genes:  
- Ceacam1 (carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1)  
- Syk (spleen tyrosine kinase)  
- Tlr4 (toll-like receptor 4)  

Other Organisms:  
- While CEACAM1, Syk, and TLR4 orthologs exist in humans and to a lesser extent in other mammals, the specific regulatory complex involving CEACAM1-4L and Syk modulation of TLR4 signaling has been most prominently characterized and experimentally validated in mouse models. Equivalent functional complexes have not been definitively described in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, or Saccharomyces cerevisiae due to missing homologs of CEACAM1 and TLR4 components.  

Self Confidence Score: 0.92  

_Rationale for confidence score:_  
- Consistency of information across databases and literature: strong support in immunology-focused publications and databases on mouse Ceacam1 and Tlr4 functions (0.28/0.30)  
- Supporting experimental data: multiple in vivo and in vitro studies in mice demonstrate CEACAM1-4L recruitment of Syk and regulation of TLR4 signaling (0.28/0.30)  
- Protein-gene mapping accuracy: well-established gene identity for Ceacam1, Syk, and Tlr4 in mouse models (0.23/0.25)

Complex Function: This multi-protein complex plays a critical role in modulating innate immune responses, particularly in the context of Toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr4) signaling upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. The complex mediates the negative regulation of Tlr4-driven inflammatory signaling through recruitment of the spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) by Ceacam1-4L (Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1, long isoform). This interaction attenuates downstream signaling cascades such as NF-κB activation, effectively dampening excessive cytokine production and inflammation.

Other Organisms: The core components, especially Tlr4 and Syk, are broadly conserved in mammals including humans; however, the functional interaction of Ceacam1-4L with Syk and Tlr4 has been most extensively characterized in Mouse. Evidence for an identical multi-protein complex with these properties outside mouse, particularly in humans, remains limited or context-dependent.

### Complex Function:
The KDR-NRP1-VEGF165 complex plays a critical role in angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from existing vasculature. VEGF165 (a major isoform of VEGF-A) binds simultaneously to the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2, also known as KDR in humans) and the neuropilin-1 (NRP1) co-receptor. This tripartite complex enhances VEGF165-mediated signaling, amplifying endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and survival, which are essential steps in the regulation of vascular development and permeability. NRP1 acts as a co-receptor that increases the affinity of VEGF165 for KDR, modulating downstream signaling pathways such as PLCγ, MAPK, and PI3K/Akt.

2. **VEGF165**:  
   - Function: The predominant isoform of VEGFA (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A) that binds KDR/VEGFR-2 to stimulate angiogenesis.

### Corresponding Genes:
- **KDR** gene for the KDR protein (Gene symbol: *KDR*), located on human chromosome 4q12.
- **VEGFA** gene for VEGF165 isoform (Gene symbol: *VEGFA*), located on human chromosome 6p21.1.

### Presence in Other Organisms:
- KDR-VEGF interactions are well characterized in **Mouse (Mus musculus)**, where the orthologous receptor is called *Flk-1* (gene symbol *Kdr*), and VEGF-A isoforms including VEGF164 (mouse analog of human VEGF165) also bind it similarly.
- Less direct homologs exist in **Drosophila melanogaster** (e.g., PDGF/VEGF-related factors) but no direct KDR-VEGF165 interaction since flies lack true VEGFR orthologs.
- No relevant homologous complex documented in **Caenorhabditis elegans** or **Saccharomyces cerevisiae**.

**Summary:**  
The KDR-VEGF165 complex in humans is a well-characterized receptor-ligand pair crucial for angiogenesis. The complex consists primarily of the KDR receptor tyrosine kinase and the VEGF165 isoform of VEGFA. Both proteins have unambiguous gene assignments. Experimental structural and biochemical data reinforce this receptor-ligand interaction. The complex is predominantly studied in humans, with strong parallels in mice but no true homologues in other model organisms mentioned. The data is highly reliable with full confidence.",,
KDR-VEGF165 complex,few-shot,ChatGPT,PARSE ERROR,UNKNOWN,"Complex Name: KDR-VEGF165 complex  
Organism: Human  

Complex Function:  
The KDR-VEGF165 complex is critical for the regulation of angiogenesis and vascular development in humans. VEGF165 (vascular endothelial growth factor isoform 165) binds to its primary receptor KDR (kinase insert domain receptor, also known as VEGFR-2), a receptor tyrosine kinase on endothelial cells. This binding activates intracellular signaling pathways that promote endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and new blood vessel formation. This process is essential for both physiological events such as wound healing and pathological conditions including tumor growth and diabetic retinopathy.

Proteins:  
- Kinase insert domain receptor (KDR/VEGFR-2)  
- Vascular endothelial growth factor isoform 165 (VEGF165)  

Genes:  
- KDR (gene encoding VEGFR-2)  
- VEGFA (gene encoding VEGF165 and other VEGF isoforms by alternative splicing)  

Other Organisms:  
The VEGF-VEGFR signaling system is conserved primarily in vertebrates. Mouse (Mus musculus) expresses orthologous proteins (Flk-1 as the KDR homolog and VEGF-A isoforms), making the KDR-VEGF165 complex also prominent in Mouse. However, in lower organisms like Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, homologous complexes do not exist or have highly divergent pathways.  

Self Confidence Score: 0.95  

**Rationale for confidence:**  
- Consistency across databases such as UniProt, NCBI Gene, and primary literature confirms the KDR-VEGF165 interaction and its role in human angiogenesis (weight 0.30).  
- Numerous experimental studies, including crystallography and functional assays, support the existence and function of this complex (weight 0.30).  
- The protein-to-gene mappings KDR → KDR and VEGF165 → VEGFA are unambiguous and well-established (weight 0.25).  
- The analysis is focused specifically on human, where this complex is most extensively studied and characterized (weight 0.15).",,

Complex Function:  
The KDR-VEGF165 complex mediates signal transduction critical for angiogenesis, vascular development, and endothelial cell function. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor 165 (VEGF165), a major isoform of VEGF-A, binds to the receptor tyrosine kinase KDR (Kinase insert Domain Receptor, also known as VEGFR-2) on endothelial cells, triggering receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation. This activates downstream signaling pathways including MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT, which promote endothelial proliferation, migration, survival, and new blood vessel formation.

- Kinase Insert Domain Receptor (KDR / VEGFR-2)

- KDR (encodes the VEGFR-2 receptor)  

Other Organisms:  
The KDR-VEGF165 interaction is most prominently studied and functionally characterized in humans. Orthologous VEGF-A and VEGFR-2 proteins exist in mouse (Mus musculus), where similar complexes operate in angiogenesis. However, KDR as a nomenclature and VEGF165 isoform are specifically defined in humans. Other model organisms have related but distinct VEGF and VEGFR homologs with differing isoforms (e.g., Flk1 in mouse corresponds to KDR). Therefore, while similar complexes exist in mouse, the exact KDR-VEGF165 complex is primarily human-specific in terms of nomenclature and isoform.

### Organism:

**Mouse (Mus musculus)**

The TMC2 protein and its associated complex are most prominently studied and functionally characterized in mice, particularly within the context of the auditory system.

---

### Complex Name:

**Transmembrane Channel-Like 2 (TMC2) complex**

---

### Complex Function:

The TMC2 complex is implicated in mechanotransduction in the inner ear hair cells of mice. Specifically, TMC2 is thought to form part of the pore-forming subunit of the mechanotransduction channel responsible for converting mechanical stimuli (sound waves) into electrical signals in cochlear hair cells, crucial for hearing.

Distinct from TMC1, which plays a dominant role in mature hair cells, TMC2 is expressed transiently in early postnatal hair cells and appears to support or complement mechanotransduction during early developmental stages. TMC2 can partially compensate for TMC1 loss and influence the conductance and calcium permeability of the mechanotransduction channels.

---

### Proteins in the Complex:

- **TMC2 protein**

Note: Unlike some complexes consisting of multiple tightly bound proteins, TMC2 functions as a pore subunit within a larger mechanotransduction complex that includes other associated proteins (like protocadherin 15 and LHFPL5), but these proteins are not consistently referred to as part of a defined ""TMC2 complex."" The defining protein here is TMC2.

### Corresponding Genes:

- **Tmc2** (Gene symbol: *Tmc2*)

---

### Other Organisms Where TMC2 is Found:

- **Human (Homo sapiens):** The human ortholog *TMC2* exists and shares sequence similarity, but its precise role in auditory mechanotransduction is much less cleared compared to mouse.
- **Other vertebrates:** Similar *Tmc2* homologs are found in other mammals and vertebrates with auditory systems.
- **Not found or not prominently characterized in:** Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

### Function:
The human COP9 Signalosome (CSN) is a highly conserved multi-protein complex that plays a crucial role in various cellular regulatory processes, specifically in protein degradation. Its primary function is to deneddylate (remove the ubiquitin-like modifier NEDD8 from) cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs), thus regulating their activity and maintaining protein homeostasis. The CSN thereby controls ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, impacting cell cycle progression, DNA repair, and signal transduction pathways. Beyond its enzymatic activity, the CSN acts as a regulator of CRL assembly/disassembly and modulates pathways such as NF-κB signaling, DNA damage response, and photomorphogenesis analogs in mammalian cells.

### Complex composition:
The COP9 Signalosome in humans consists of **eight subunits**, named CSN1 through CSN8, each encoded by a separate gene:

GRIN1-P2RY4 complex,zero-shot,ChatGPT,PARSE ERROR,UNKNOWN,"**Organism:** Human (*Homo sapiens*)

---

### Complex Name:
**GRIN1-P2RY4 complex**

---

### Complex Function:
The GRIN1-P2RY4 complex refers to a protein interaction involving GRIN1 (a subunit of the NMDA receptor) and P2RY4 (a purinergic G protein-coupled receptor). In humans, GRIN1 is critical for NMDA receptor function, which is involved in synaptic transmission, plasticity, and excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. P2RY4 is a G protein-coupled receptor responsive to nucleotides like UTP and ATP, implicated in modulation of neuronal signaling pathways and glial functions.

The hypothetical complex between GRIN1 and P2RY4 suggests a functional interaction where P2RY4 signaling might modulate NMDA receptor activity, contributing to fine-tuning synaptic responses or neurophysiological processes. However, direct stable complex formation evidence is limited and mostly derived from functional assays rather than structurally stable complexes.

---

### Proteins in the Complex:
- **GRIN1**: N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit 1
- **P2RY4**: Pyrimidinergic receptor P2Y4

---

### Corresponding Genes:
- **GRIN1 gene**: *GRIN1* (Gene ID: 2902, Human)
- **P2RY4 gene**: *P2RY4* (Gene ID: 5029, Human)

---

### Other Organisms Containing This Complex:
- Orthologous proteins exist individually in **Mouse** (*Mus musculus*) where both *Grin1* and *P2ry4* genes are present and widely studied in neuroscience. There is no confirmed evidence of a physical protein complex between these two proteins in mouse, but functional interactions via signaling pathways may exist.
- In **Drosophila melanogaster** and **Caenorhabditis elegans**, orthologs of GRIN1 or P2RY4 are either not well-conserved or absent, hence no known complex.
- **Saccharomyces cerevisiae** does not contain orthologs for these proteins; no presence of this complex.

---

### Summary:
The GRIN1-P2RY4 complex is most specific and relevant in humans, possibly representing functional crosstalk between glutamate NMDA receptor function (GRIN1) and purinergic signaling (P2RY4). Experimental evidence for a direct stable protein complex is limited; available data mainly suggest potential signaling interactions. The mapping of proteins to genes is well established in human databases.

PHO85-PHO80 CDK-cyclin complex,contextual,ChatGPT,PARSE ERROR,UNKNOWN,"Complex Name: PHO85-PHO80 CDK-cyclin complex  
Organism: Saccharomyces cerevisiae  
Complex Function: The PHO85-PHO80 complex is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-cyclin complex that plays a critical regulatory role in phosphate metabolism. It controls the cell cycle and transcriptional responses to phosphate availability by phosphorylating specific transcription factors such as Pho4, thereby regulating the expression of genes involved in phosphate uptake and homeostasis. Beyond phosphate metabolism, it is also implicated in broader cell cycle control, nutrient sensing, and aging.  

Proteins:  
- PHO85 (Cyclin-dependent kinase)  
- PHO80 (Cyclin)  

Genes:  
- PHO85 (gene: PHO85)  
- PHO80 (gene: PHO80)  

Other Organisms:  
The PHO85-PHO80 CDK-cyclin complex is most extensively characterized in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. No direct orthologous complex with exactly the same cyclin-CDK pairing and function is established in humans, mouse, *C. elegans*, or *D. melanogaster*. However, functional analogs of CDK-cyclin complexes exist broadly in eukaryotes but with different components and regulatory mechanisms.

#### Organism:
**Human (Homo sapiens)**

DNA polymerase epsilon (Pol ε) is most prominently characterized and studied in humans relative to the specified organisms.

---

#### Complex Name:
DNA Polymerase epsilon (Pol ε)

---

#### Complex Function:
DNA polymerase epsilon in humans is a multi-subunit enzyme crucial for DNA replication, particularly responsible for synthesizing the leading strand during S phase. It also plays roles in DNA repair and maintaining replication fork stability.

---

#### Protein Components and Corresponding Genes:

| Protein Subunit                  | Gene Symbol     |
|-------------------------------|-----------------|
| Catalytic subunit (Pol2)       | POLE            |
| Subunit 2                      | POLE2           |
| Subunit 3                      | POLE3           |
| Subunit 4                      | POLE4           |

- **POLE** encodes the large catalytic subunit with polymerase and exonuclease activity.
- **POLE2**, **POLE3**, and **POLE4** encode accessory subunits essential for holoenzyme assembly, processivity, and interaction with other replication factors.

---

#### Other Organisms with Pol ε Complex:

- **Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast)**: Pol ε is also well-characterized with homologous subunits (POL2, DPB2, DPB3, and DPB4).
- **Mouse (Mus musculus)**: Highly conserved Pol ε subunits analogous to human genes.
- **Drosophila melanogaster** and **Caenorhabditis elegans**: Homologous Pol ε complexes exist with significant conservation, although less extensively studied.

However, the most detailed functional and structural data and disease linkage information relate to the human complex, especially in the context of cancer biology.

---

#### Self-Confidence Score Calculation:

- **Consistency across databases/sources (0.3 weight):**  
  Consistent annotations of Pol ε composition and function are found across UniProt, NCBI Gene, KEGG, and literature (0.27).

- **Supporting experimental data (0.3 weight):**  
  Numerous biochemical, structural, and genetic studies including cryo-EM, mutagenesis, and clinical mutation correlations in humans (0.29).

- **Protein-gene mapping accuracy (0.25 weight):**  
  Well-established one-to-one mapping between POLE and its subunits; no ambiguity in gene-subunit relationships (0.25).

- **Analysis specificity to human (0.15 weight):**  
  The analysis focuses strictly on human data with clear distinction from other organisms (0.15).

---

**Overall confidence score:**

\[
(0.27 \times 0.3) + (0.29 \times 0.3) + (0.25 \times 0.25) + (0.15 \times 0.15) = 0.081 + 0.087 + 0.0625 + 0.0225 = 0.253
\]

This raw sum is not the final score yet since weights sum to 1, this calculation rather should be:

\[
0.27 + 0.29 + 0.25 + 0.15 = 0.96
\]

To be clear, weights are to scale each criterion, so multiply each by weight and sum:

\[
(0.27 \times 0.3) + (0.29 \times 0.3) + (0.25 \times 0.25) + (0.15 \times 0.15) = 
\]

\[
0.081 + 0.087 + 0.0625 + 0.0225 = 0.253
\]

This low figure indicates values around 0.25, which is lower than expected. But confidence weights were meant to be applied to the criterion score between 0 and 1, so these criterion scores must represent these accuracies on 1.0 scale.

Re-assessing:

Assign scores for each:

- Consistency: 0.9 (well consistent)
- Experimental data: 0.95 (strong data)
- Protein-gene mapping: 1.0 (exact mapping)
- Specificity to human: 1.0 (focused on human)

Apply weights:

\[
(0.9 \times 0.3) + (0.95 \times 0.3) + (1.0 \times 0.25) + (1.0 \times 0.15) = 0.27 + 0.285 + 0.25 + 0.15 = 0.955

**Complex Name:** GPI-anchor transamidase complex  

### Complex Function  
The GPI-anchor transamidase complex in humans catalyzes the post-translational modification of proteins by attaching glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors to the C-terminus of target proteins. This process is crucial for anchoring proteins to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, particularly for proteins lacking transmembrane domains but needing membrane localization. The complex recognizes a specific GPI attachment signal sequence, cleaves it, and transfers the preassembled GPI anchor to the protein.

### Protein Components and Corresponding Genes in Humans  
The human GPI-anchor transamidase complex consists of at least five core subunits:

| Protein Subunit    | Corresponding Gene | Notes               |
|-------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| GPAA1             | GPAA1              | GPI anchoring protein 1, scaffold and enzymatic role |

| PIGU              | PIGU               | Contributes to enzymatic activity and complex stability |

### Other Organisms with the GPI-anchor transamidase Complex  
The GPI-anchor transamidase complex is conserved in several eukaryotes, including:  
- Mouse (Mus musculus)  
- Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast)  
- Caenorhabditis elegans  
- Drosophila melanogaster  

Homologs of the human subunits exist in these organisms, and they perform the analogous function of GPI anchor attachment. However, the human complex is prominent in the context of mammalian cell biology and disease studies.

Organism: Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast)  

Complex Function:  
The PAN1 complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae serves as a critical regulator of the actin cytoskeleton involved in endocytosis. It facilitates actin patch formation by linking the cortical actin cytoskeleton to endocytic sites. PAN1 acts as a scaffold protein coordinating multiple interactions that promote actin filament nucleation and organization during clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

Proteins:  
- Pan1p (ScPan1) – the core scaffold protein  
- End3p – an endocytic adaptor interacting with Pan1p  
- Sla1p – an actin-binding adaptor that forms a complex with Pan1 and End3  
- Other associated proteins include components like Las17p (yeast WASp homolog), which interact indirectly through PAN1 complex components but are not core structural components  

Genes:  
- PAN1 (for Pan1p)  
- END3 (for End3p)  
- SLA1 (for Sla1p)  

Other Organisms:  
The PAN1 complex is most prominently characterized in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Homologous proteins and complexes exist in other fungi and eukaryotes (e.g., the Eps15 and intersectin family in mammals), but the PAN1 complex as defined is specifically a yeast complex. Analogous functional complexes exist in humans (involving Eps15, Intersectin, and other actin-regulatory proteins), but they are not direct homologous complexes termed PAN1.

### Organism  
*Homo sapiens* (Human)

### Complex Name  
Augmin complex (also called the HAUS complex in humans)

### Complex Function  
The Augmin complex is a crucial microtubule-associated protein complex that facilitates centrosome-independent microtubule nucleation within the mitotic spindle. It acts by recruiting the γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) to existing spindle microtubules, promoting branching microtubule nucleation and thus enhancing spindle microtubule density. This function ensures proper spindle assembly, accurate chromosome segregation, and mitotic progression.

### Protein Composition of the Human Augmin Complex (HAUS complex)

---

### Supporting Details Specific to Human Augmin Complex  
- The HAUS complex (Augmin) localizes to the mitotic spindle and promotes γ-TuRC recruitment to spindle microtubules.  
- Disruption of any HAUS subunit in human cells by RNAi leads to decreased spindle microtubule density and chromosome mis-segregation phenotypes.  
- The eight HAUS proteins form a stable hetero-octameric complex, structurally resolved in recent cryo-EM studies, confirming protein-protein interactions and overall architecture.  
- The gene-protein mapping is unequivocal, with one-to-one correspondence between HAUS genes and HAUS protein subunits.

ATG1 protein kinase complex,zero-shot,ChatGPT,PARSE ERROR,UNKNOWN,"### Analysis of the ATG1 Protein Kinase Complex

---

#### Organism:
**Saccharomyces cerevisiae** (Baker's yeast)

#### Complex Name:
**ATG1 protein kinase complex**

#### Complex Function:
The ATG1 complex in *S. cerevisiae* is a crucial regulator of autophagy initiation. It integrates nutrient status signals to trigger autophagosome formation during starvation or stress, primarily by phosphorylating downstream effectors that coordinate autophagosome membrane nucleation and expansion. The complex controls the early steps of autophagy and is essential for selective and non-selective autophagy.

#### Proteins and Corresponding Genes in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*:
- **Atg1** (Gene: *ATG1*) – Serine/threonine protein kinase, catalytic subunit.
- **Atg13** (Gene: *ATG13*) – Regulatory subunit; its phosphorylation state modulates complex activity.
- **Atg17** (Gene: *ATG17*) – Scaffold protein organizing complex assembly.
- **Atg29** (Gene: *ATG29*) – Stabilizes the complex, aiding correct localization.
- **Atg31** (Gene: *ATG31*) – Works with Atg29 for complex stability and function.

The complex assembly typically forms a pentameric structure (Atg1-Atg13-Atg17-Atg29-Atg31) and recruits additional autophagy machinery components as autophagy proceeds.

#### Presence in Other Organisms:
The ATG1 complex is conserved evolutionarily but has species-specific components and complexities.

- **Humans and Mammals (Mouse, Human):** The functional homolog is the **ULK1 complex** (ULK1, ATG13, FIP200, ATG101), which performed an analogous role but with distinct accessory proteins and regulation.
- **Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans:** Have similar complexes with homologous proteins (e.g., Drosophila Atg1 kinase), but composition and regulatory feedback differ.
  
Thus, the ATG1 protein kinase complex term strictly applies in the canonical sense to *S. cerevisiae*. Mammals have the ULK complex performing similar functions under a different assembly.

### Organism
- **Drosophila melanogaster**

---

### Complex Name
- **HipHop-HOAP telomere-capping complex**

---

### Complex Function
- The HipHop-HOAP complex plays a critical role in **telomere protection** specifically in *Drosophila melanogaster*. It prevents the chromosome ends (telomeres) from being recognized as DNA double-strand breaks, thereby avoiding unwanted DNA damage responses such as end-to-end fusion or degradation. This complex is key to maintaining genome stability in *D. melanogaster* by capping chromosome ends.

- This function is particularly important in *Drosophila*, which lacks the canonical telomerase mechanism and instead uses specialized retrotransposon arrays at telomeres. The HipHop-HOAP complex is involved in forming a protective cap that stabilizes these telomeric structures.

---

### Proteins in the Complex
- **HipHop**
- **HOAP** (HP1/ORC-Associated Protein)

---

### Corresponding Genes
- **HipHop** protein is encoded by the **hiphop** gene.
- **HOAP** protein is encoded by the **clockwork orange (cw or hoap)** gene.

**Note:** The ""clockwork orange"" term is related to the gene name which encodes HOAP; it is often referred to simply as hoap gene in studies.

---

### Additional Organisms
- The **HipHop-HOAP complex is specific to *Drosophila melanogaster*** or closely related Drosophila species.
- Homologous telomere-capping mechanisms exist in other organisms (like humans, mice) but involve structurally and functionally different protein complexes (e.g., the shelterin complex in mammals).

The nuclear mitotic cohesin complex is most prominently studied and characterized in humans, where it plays a critical role in chromosome dynamics during mitosis.

---

### Complex Name  
**Nuclear Mitotic Cohesin Complex**

---

### Complex Function  
The nuclear mitotic cohesin complex mediates sister chromatid cohesion during mitosis, ensuring accurate chromosome segregation. It also contributes to DNA repair and regulation of gene expression through chromatin organization. During mitosis, cohesin establishes and maintains cohesion between replicated sister chromatids from S phase until anaphase, when its cleavage triggers sister chromatid separation.

### Proteins Constituting the Nuclear Mitotic Cohesin Complex and Corresponding Genes

| Protein Name              | Gene Symbol  |
|-------------------------|--------------|
| Structural maintenance of chromosomes protein 1A (SMC1A) | SMC1A         |
| Structural maintenance of chromosomes protein 3 (SMC3) | SMC3          |
| RAD21 (Scc1 homolog)     | RAD21        |
| Stromal antigen 1        | STAG1        |
| Stromal antigen 2        | STAG2        |

- **SMC1A** and **SMC3** form a V-shaped heterodimer that acts as the core of the cohesin ring.  
- **RAD21** acts as a kleisin subunit that closes the ring by connecting SMC1A and SMC3.  
- **STAG1** or **STAG2** (also called SA1 and SA2 respectively) are accessory subunits that regulate cohesin's association with chromatin and its stability during mitosis.

---

### Other Organisms Where the Protein Complex is Found  
The mitotic cohesin complex is evolutionarily conserved and found across eukaryotes, including:

- **Mouse (Mus musculus)** – highly similar complex with analogous proteins SMC1A, SMC3, RAD21, and STAG variants.  
- **Saccharomyces cerevisiae** – cohesin consists of SMC1, SMC3, SCC1 (RAD21 homolog), and SCC3 (STAG homolog).  
- **Drosophila melanogaster** – homologous complex involving SMC proteins, RAD21, and stromalin.  
- **Caenorhabditis elegans** – cohesin core conserved, but with some differences in accessory components.

However, naming and specific paralogs can vary, and some accessory factors are species-specific.

### Organism
**Saccharomyces cerevisiae** (Baker's yeast)

---

### Complex Name
Ste12/Dig1/Dig2 Transcription Regulation Complex

---

### Complex Function
The Ste12/Dig1/Dig2 complex functions predominantly in the regulation of mating-specific gene expression in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. Ste12 is a transcription factor essential for the activation of genes required for yeast mating and filamentous growth pathways. Dig1 and Dig2 act as negative regulators of Ste12 by binding to it and repressing transcriptional activation. This complex modulates the pheromone-responsive MAPK signaling pathway, controlling the timing and intensity of mating gene expression to fine-tune cellular responses to mating pheromones.

---

### Proteins Constituting the Complex
- **Ste12**: Transcription factor responsible for activating mating and invasive growth genes.
- **Dig1**: Negative regulator that associates with Ste12 to inhibit its activity.
- **Dig2**: Another inhibitory regulator that binds Ste12, functioning similarly to Dig1 but with potentially partially distinct roles.

---

### Corresponding Genes
- **STE12** gene encodes Ste12 protein.
- **DIG1** gene encodes Dig1 protein.
- **DIG2** gene encodes Dig2 protein.

All of these genes are well-characterized in *S. cerevisiae* and are integral parts of the yeast mating pheromone response pathway.

---

### Presence in Other Organisms
The Ste12/Dig1/Dig2 complex as defined is **specific to *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* and closely related yeast species**. Homologs of Ste12 exist in other fungi, but the exact analogs of Dig1 and Dig2 and their specific regulatory interactions are less conserved and have not been demonstrated in model organisms such as humans, mice, *Caenorhabditis elegans*, or *Drosophila melanogaster*. Therefore, this precise complex is mostly unique to budding yeast species involved in fungal mating regulation.

Ste12 is a sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factor that activates mating-specific genes when the pheromone signaling pathway is induced. Dig1 and Dig2 act as negative regulators or repressors, binding to Ste12 to inhibit its transcriptional activation under non-inducing conditions.

**Other Organisms where TRAPP II is Found:**

- Homologs of TRAPP II have been characterized in *Homo sapiens* (humans), *Mus musculus* (mouse), and *Drosophila melanogaster*. The complex is conserved across eukaryotes, with functional homologs identified that regulate distinct Golgi trafficking routes. Human TRAPP II shares similar core functions but may contain divergent subunits and regulatory mechanisms due to organismal complexity.

---

**Summary:**

- The most detailed, experimentally supported understanding of TRAPP II resides in *S. cerevisiae*.
- TRAPP II extends the TRAPP I core by adding Trs120 and Trs130, specializing it for late Golgi/TGN functions.

- The CCM complex is most prominently studied and characterized in **Humans**.
- The complex is also found in **Mouse (Mus musculus)** with high orthology and similar functional roles in vascular biology.
- Evidence in **Drosophila melanogaster** suggests functional orthologs though the CCM complex is less structurally conserved.
- The CCM complex is not known to be present in **Caenorhabditis elegans** or **Saccharomyces cerevisiae** as a defined complex; thus, the functional and genetic characterization is primarily in vertebrates, especially humans and mice.

---

### Additional Notes:
- The CCM proteins physically interact forming a stable complex in endothelial cells.
- Mutations in any of the three genes cause familial cerebral cavernous malformations.
- Functional studies include knockout mouse models and patient-derived mutations confirming the importance of this complex.

- **Organism:** *Homo sapiens* (Human)  
The cardiac troponin complex is most prominently studied and characterized in humans, where it plays a critical role in cardiac muscle contraction regulation.

- **Complex Name:** Cardiac Troponin Complex

- **Function:**  
The cardiac troponin complex regulates the calcium-mediated interaction between actin and myosin filaments in cardiac muscle tissue, thereby controlling cardiac muscle contraction and relaxation. It acts as a calcium-sensitive switch enabling the heart to contract in response to calcium ion flux, essential for heartbeats.

- **Protein Composition:**  
The complex consists of three subunits:  
1. **Troponin C (TnC)** – Binds calcium ions.  
2. **Troponin I (TnI)** – Inhibitory subunit that prevents actomyosin ATPase activity in the absence of calcium.  
3. **Troponin T (TnT)** – Binds the troponin complex to tropomyosin.

- **Corresponding Genes:**  
1. **TNNC1** – Encodes cardiac Troponin C.  
2. **TNNI3** – Encodes cardiac Troponin I.  
3. **TNNT2** – Encodes cardiac Troponin T.

- **Other Organisms Where the Complex is Found (with a cardiac-specific role):**

Complex Function: The cardiac troponin complex regulates cardiac muscle contraction through calcium-sensitive control of actin-myosin interactions. It serves as the key regulatory unit in the thin filament of cardiac muscle, modulating contraction and relaxation in response to intracellular Ca²⁺ levels. Upon calcium binding, conformational changes in the complex enable actin-myosin cross-bridge formation, facilitating cardiac muscle contraction.  

Proteins:

Other Organisms:  
The cardiac troponin complex is also found in Mouse and to some extent in other vertebrates with highly conserved sequences and analogous function. Invertebrates like Drosophila melanogaster have troponin complexes but with differences adapted to their muscle types; thus, the cardiac-specific complex as in humans is primarily prominent in vertebrates such as Mouse and Human.
