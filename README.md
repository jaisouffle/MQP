TO RUN BATCHES:

1. adjust complexes as needed in make_batch.py
2. run make_batch.py to generate batches in .jsonl file 
3. download output file from OpenAI web interface
4. run parse_output.py to convert to csv
   - it should produce a file but the parsing is a bit bugged







`future`
- add download function
- fix parsing with batches
- possibilty add dataset capability so don't have to manually enter complex names
