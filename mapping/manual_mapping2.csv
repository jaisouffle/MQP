GNA12-GPR55-RGS2 complex,Homo Sapiens,"G-protein coupled receptor 55 (GPR55) is one of GPCRs and activated by endogenous cannabinoids. A family of regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS) stimulates GTP hydrolysis of alpha subunit of G-protein (Galpha) and inhibits GPCR/Galpha-mediated signaling. RGS2 is member of R4 RGS family and mainly attenuates GPCR/G(alpha)q signaling. GPR55 interacted with RGS2 alone and also formed a ternary complex with RGS2 and either G(alpha)q or G(alpha)12. In the presence of GPR55 alone and together with G(alpha)q or G(alpha)12, RGS2 translocated from the cytoplasm to plasma membrane while RGS1 remained in the cytoplasm. GPR55 activation significantly induced ERK phosphorylation and intracellular calcium mobilization, which were markedly inhibited by RGS2 in HCT116 colon cancer cell line. Furthermore, GPR55-mediated cell proliferation and migration of HCT116 cells, was significantly attenuated by RGS2 (PMID: 33092790).","Guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit alpha-12 ; G-protein coupled receptor 55 ; Regulator of G-protein signaling 2	","GNA12

Melanocortin receptor 3,Homo Sapiens,"Melanocortin receptors 1 (MC1) and MC3 form homo- and heterodimers, when expressed in Cos-7 cells. Treatment with agonist, partial agonist or antagonists did not modify the BRET(2) signal for any of the receptor pairs studied, suggesting that the dimerization is not regulated by ligand binding. Rather the results indicate that melanocortin receptors exist as constitutively pre-formed dimers (PMID: 15582585).

This indicates, that the complex is necessary to fine-tune IL-1beta production in LPS treated neutrophils to prevent hyper-inflammation.

HCN1-HCN4 complex,Homo Sapiens,"CN channel subunits assemble to a variety of different heteromers. Only one pair of channel subunits, HCN2 and HCN3, makes an exception and does not form a functional heteromer. Although HCN2 and HCN3 subunits could be easily detected in the plasma membrane, there was no obvious colocalization of the two proteins. In accordance with this finding HCN2 and HCN3 are not coimmunoprecipitated by specific antibodies. Interestingly, cells coexpressing HCN2 and HCN3 exhibited a significantly reduced current density compared with cells expressing HCN2 alone. One explanation for this result is that in the presence of HCN3 less functional HCN2 channel protein is inserted into the plasma membrane. Homomeric HCN3 channels can probably not compensate for the resulting reduction in current amplitude because for unknown reasons HCN3 produces notoriously small currents.

GRIN1-P2RY4 complex ,Homo Sapiens,"The P2Y4 receptor and the NMDAR1 subunit are inversely modulated in cerebellar granule neurons under glucose starvation (P2Y4 is upregulated and restored to basal levels by the neuroprotective P2 and NMDA antagonists, whereas NMDAR1 undergoes protein down-regulation again counteracted by the same antagonists). The upregulation of the P2Y4 in SH-SY5Y cells by transfection causes an inhibitory expression of the NMDAR1. Both P2Y4 and NMDAR1 actively participate to the metabolic impairment and the consequent cell death, although the elevated expression of the P2Y4 in SH-SY5Y cells by transfection is sufficient to cause hypoglycemic cell death. The purinergic metabotropic P2Y4 and the glutamatergic ionotropic NMDAR1 display strict co-localization and direct molecular association. P2Y4 is the first purinergic metabotropic receptor to be causal to cell death under conditions of metabolism impairment (PMID: 15383322).

Plays a key role in the integrity of the endothelial tubule networks at the initial stages of vasculogenesis. Appears to act primarily by inhibiting RhoA-associated kinase (ROCK) activation and thus regulating Rhoa (Q9QUI0) signaling however distinct patterns of interacting proteins for each CCM protein has been observed.

mu-Calpain complex ,Mus Musculus,"A calcium-dependent protease complex that processes the substrate by limited proteolysis rather than degrading it. In some cases the proteolytic action activates the substrate, for example, it cleaves Cdk5r1/p35 (P61809) into its p25 form that is associated with Alzheimer's disease in human. Involved in cytoskeletal remodeling, signal transduction and implicated in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. Finely-balanced calpain homeostasis is required as both over and under-activation causes disease. Calpain complexes recognise their substrates based on a short peptide sequence. Inhibited by the intrinsically-unstructured calpastatin (P51125) by its tight binding to the calpain catalytic subunit.",Capn1; Capns1,Capn1,O35350; O88456

20S mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit ,Mus Musculus,"Component of the ribosome, the site of protein biosynthesis resulting from translation of messenger RNA (mRNA). Responsible for the catalytic activity of the ribosome, the peptidyltransferase activity required to catalyze peptide bond formation. The mitochondrial ribosome (mitoribosome) is responsible for the synthesis of mitochondrial genome-encoded proteins, including at least some of the essential transmembrane subunits of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. All proteins synthesized by mouse mitoribosomes are hydrophobic, integral membrane proteins and some require prosthetic groups for folding and functioning. The mitoribosomes are tethered to the mitochondrial inner membrane and translation products are cotranslationally integrated into the membrane. The inner membrane protein Mrpl45 aligns the mitochondrial peptide exit tunnel with the membrane insertion machinery and supports the transfer of the mitochondrial nascent peptides towards the membrane. The mt-SSU binds mRNA, is involved in accurate initiation and decoding, and undergoes large-scale conformational changes during the elongation cycle.",Mrps27; Mrps18b; Mrps22; Dap3; Aurkaip1; Mrps15; Mrps18c; Mrps23; Mrps26; Mrps33; Mrps6; Chchd1; Mrps12; Mrps16; Mrps2; Mrps24; Mrps28; Mrps34; Mrps7; Mrps14; Mrps17; Mrps21; Mrps25; Mrps31; Mrps5; Mrps9; Ptcd3; ,"Mrps27

Cardiac troponin complex ,Mus Musculus,"Regulates contraction-relaxation cycles in response to changes in intracellular calcium. Together with tropomyosin, cTn is generally located along polymerised actin, which forms the backbone of the cardiomyocyte thin filament. At resting levels of intracellular calcium, the cTn complex keeps tropomyosin in a position that prevents force-producing interactions between myosin heads and actin. When the muscle cell is stimulated to contract by an action potential, calcium channels open in the sarcoplasmic membrane and release calcium into the sarcoplasm. Some of this calcium binds to specific sites in the N-domain of TnC, triggering a series of protein structural changes and tropomyosin is rolled away from myosin-binding sites on actin, allowing myosin to attach to the thin filament and produce force and/or shorten the sarcomere of the cardiomyocyte.",Tnnt2; Tnni3; Tnnc1,"Tnnt2
