When VEGF165 binds to both KDR (VEGFR2) and NRP1 (Neuropilin-1) simultaneously, it enhances VEGFR2 signaling compared to VEGF binding to VEGFR2 alone. The complex triggers downstream phosphorylation cascades that promote endothelial cell survival, proliferation, migration, and vascular permeability. This trimeric complex is essential for proper blood vessel formation during development and wound healing, as well as in pathological conditions like tumor angiogenesis. NRP1 acts as a co-receptor that increases the binding affinity of VEGF165 to VEGFR2 and enhances signaling output.\n\n## Other Organisms\nMouse (Mus musculus)\n\n## Proteins\n1.
